<h3 class="section">3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h3>
<a name="index-options-to-control-warnings"></a>
<a name="index-warning-messages"></a>
<a name="index-messages_002c-warning"></a>
<a name="index-suppressing-warnings"></a>

<p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
</p>
<p>The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-syntax-checking"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsyntax_002donly"></a>
<p>Check the code for syntax errors, but don&rsquo;t do anything beyond that.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmax-errors=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmax_002derrors"></a>
<p>Limits the maximum number of error messages to <var>n</var>, at which point
GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If <var>n</var> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If <samp>-Wfatal-errors</samp> is also
specified, then <samp>-Wfatal-errors</samp> takes precedence over this
option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-w</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-w"></a>
<p>Inhibit all warning messages.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Werror</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Werror"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002derror"></a>
<p>Make all warnings into errors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Werror=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Werror_003d"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002derror_003d"></a>
<p>Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example <samp>-Werror=switch</samp> turns the warnings
controlled by <samp>-Wswitch</samp> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <samp>-Werror</samp> for specific
warnings; for example <samp>-Wno-error=switch</samp> makes
<samp>-Wswitch</samp> warnings not be errors, even when <samp>-Werror</samp>
is in effect.
</p>
<p>The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
<samp>-Werror=</samp> and <samp>-Wno-error=</samp> as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
<samp>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</samp> flag.)
</p>
<p>Note that specifying <samp>-Werror=</samp><var>foo</var> automatically implies
<samp>-W</samp><var>foo</var>.  However, <samp>-Wno-error=</samp><var>foo</var> does not
imply anything.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wfatal-errors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wfatal_002derrors"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dfatal_002derrors"></a>
<p>This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
&lsquo;<samp>-W</samp>&rsquo;, for example <samp>-Wimplicit</samp> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning &lsquo;<samp>-Wno-</samp>&rsquo; to turn off warnings; for
example, <samp>-Wno-implicit</samp>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and
<a href="Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.
</p>
<p>When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<samp>-Wunknown-warning</samp>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <samp>-Wno-</samp> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for <samp>-Wno-unknown-warning</samp> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new <samp>-Wno-</samp> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-Wpedantic</code></dt>
<dt><code>-pedantic</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pedantic-1"></a>
<a name="index-Wpedantic"></a>
<p>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <samp>-std</samp> option used.
</p>
<p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require <samp>-ansi</samp> or a
<samp>-std</samp> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
</p>
<p><samp>-Wpedantic</samp> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with &lsquo;<samp>__</samp>&rsquo;.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
See <a href="Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.
</p>
<p>Some users try to use <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all&mdash;only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
</p>
<p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>.  We don&rsquo;t have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
</p>
<p>Where the standard specified with <samp>-std</samp> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as &lsquo;<samp>gnu90</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>gnu99</samp>&rsquo;, there is a
corresponding <em>base standard</em>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-1"></a>
<p>Like <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wall</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wall"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dall"></a>
<p>This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and <a href="Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.
</p>
<p><samp>-Wall</samp> turns on the following warning flags:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">

</pre></div>

<p>Note that some warning flags are not implied by <samp>-Wall</samp>.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by <samp>-Wextra</samp> but many of
them must be enabled individually.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wextra</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-W"></a>
<a name="index-Wextra"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dextra"></a>
<p>This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by
<samp>-Wall</samp>. (This option used to be called <samp>-W</samp>.  The older
name is still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)
</p>
<div class="smallexample">

<p>The option <samp>-Wextra</samp> also prints warning messages for the

<ul>
<li> A pointer is compared against integer zero with &lsquo;<samp>&lt;</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>&lt;=</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>&gt;=</samp>&rsquo;.

<dt><code>-Wchar-subscripts</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wchar_002dsubscripts"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dchar_002dsubscripts"></a>
<p>Warn if an array subscript has type <code>char</code>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines.
This warning is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wcomment</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wcomment"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dcomment"></a>
<p>Warn whenever a comment-start sequence &lsquo;<samp>/*</samp>&rsquo; appears in a &lsquo;<samp>/*</samp>&rsquo;
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a &lsquo;<samp>//</samp>&rsquo; comment.
This warning is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wno_002dcoverage_002dmismatch"></a>
<p>Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
<samp>-fprofile-use</samp> option.
If a source file is changed between compiling with <samp>-fprofile-gen</samp> and
with <samp>-fprofile-use</samp>, the files with the profile feedback can fail
to match the source file and GCC cannot use the profile feedback
information.  By default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an
error.  <samp>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</samp> can be used to disable the
warning or <samp>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</samp> can be used to
disable the error.  Disabling the error for this warning can result in
poorly optimized code and is useful only in the
case of very minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing code-base.
Completely disabling the warning is not recommended.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wno-cpp</code></dt>
<dd><p><span class="roman">(C, Objective-C, C++, Objective-C++ and Fortran only)</span>
</p>
<p>Suppress warning messages emitted by <code>#warning</code> directives.

<dd><a name="index-Wdouble_002dpromotion"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002ddouble_002dpromotion"></a>
<p>Give a warning when a value of type <code>float</code> is implicitly
promoted to <code>double</code>.  CPUs with a 32-bit &ldquo;single-precision&rdquo;
floating-point unit implement <code>float</code> in hardware, but emulate
<code>double</code> in software.  On such a machine, doing computations
using <code>double</code> values is much more expensive because of the
overhead required for software emulation.
</p>
<p>It is easy to accidentally do computations with <code>double</code> because
floating-point literals are implicitly of type <code>double</code>.  For
example, in:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">float area(float radius)
{
   return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
}
</pre></div>
<p>the compiler performs the entire computation with <code>double</code>
because the floating-point literal is a <code>double</code>.

<a name="index-ffreestanding-2"></a>
<a name="index-fno_002dbuiltin-1"></a>
<a name="index-Wformat_003d"></a>
<p>Check calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), in the <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> and <code>strfmon</code> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
<samp>-ffreestanding</samp> or <samp>-fno-builtin</samp>.
</p>
<p>The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library&rsquo;s limitations.  However, if <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> is used
with <samp>-Wformat</samp>, warnings are given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for <code>strfmon</code> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

<dt><code>-Wformat</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wformat-1"></a>
<a name="index-Wformat_003d1"></a>
<p>Option <samp>-Wformat</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-Wformat=1</samp>, and
<samp>-Wno-format</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-Wformat=0</samp>.  Since
<samp>-Wformat</samp> also checks for null format arguments for several
functions, <samp>-Wformat</samp> also implies <samp>-Wnonnull</samp>.  Some
aspects of this level of format checking can be disabled by the
options: <samp>-Wno-format-contains-nul</samp>,
<samp>-Wno-format-extra-args</samp>, and <samp>-Wno-format-zero-length</samp>.
<samp>-Wformat</samp> is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp>.

<dd><a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002dextra_002dargs"></a>
<a name="index-Wformat_002dextra_002dargs"></a>
<p>If <samp>-Wformat</samp> is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
<code>printf</code> or <code>scanf</code> format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.
</p>
<p>Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to <code>va_arg</code> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of <code>scanf</code> formats, this option suppresses the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.

<p>If <samp>-Wformat</samp> is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.
The C standard specifies that zero-length formats are allowed.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>-Wformat=2</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wformat_003d2"></a>

<p>If <samp>-Wformat</samp> is specified, also warn if the format string is not a
string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the format function
takes its format arguments as a <code>va_list</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wformat-security</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wformat_002dsecurity"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002dsecurity"></a>
<p>If <samp>-Wformat</samp> is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in <code>printf (foo);</code>.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains &lsquo;<samp>%n</samp>&rsquo;.  (This is
currently a subset of what <samp>-Wformat-nonliteral</samp> warns about, but
in future warnings may be added to <samp>-Wformat-security</samp> that are not
included in <samp>-Wformat-nonliteral</samp>.)

<p>Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such

is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
</p>
<p>Also warn if a comparison like &lsquo;<samp>x&lt;=y&lt;=z</samp>&rsquo; appears; this is
equivalent to &lsquo;<samp>(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z</samp>&rsquo;, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
</p>
<p>Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<code>if</code> statement an <code>else</code> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">{
  if (a)
    if (b)
      foo ();
  else
    bar ();
}
</pre></div>

<p>In C/C++, every <code>else</code> branch belongs to the innermost possible
<code>if</code> statement, which in this example is <code>if (b)</code>.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost <code>if</code> statement so there is no way the <code>else</code>
can belong to the enclosing <code>if</code>.  The resulting code
looks like this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">{
  if (a)
    {
      if (b)
        foo ();
      else
        bar ();
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to
<code>?:</code> with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the <code>?</code>: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.

<dd><a name="index-Wsequence_002dpoint"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dsequence_002dpoint"></a>
<p>Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.
</p>
<p>The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of <em>sequence points</em>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>? :</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
</p>
<p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that &ldquo;Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.&rdquo;.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
</p>
<p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a = a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
= b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++] = i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
</p>
<p>The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</a>.

<p>Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized

warn if a non-static reference or non-static &lsquo;<samp>const</samp>&rsquo; member
appears in a class without constructors.
</p>
<p>If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of the

<p>These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared <code>volatile</code>.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings depends on the precise optimization
options and version of GCC used.

<dt><code>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wmaybe_002duninitialized"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dmaybe_002duninitialized"></a>
<p>For an automatic variable, if there exists a path from the function
entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the compiler
emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not
executed at run time. These warnings are made optional because GCC is
not smart enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">{
  int x;
  switch (y)
    {
    case 1: x = 1;
      break;
    case 2: x = 4;
      break;
    case 3: x = 5;
    }
  foo (x);
}
</pre></div>

<p>If the value of <code>y</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>x</code> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn&rsquo;t know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with assert(0) or
similar code.
</p>
<a name="index-longjmp-warnings"></a>
<p>This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <code>longjmp</code>.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.
</p>
<p>The compiler sees only the calls to <code>setjmp</code>.  It cannot know
where <code>longjmp</code> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <code>longjmp</code> cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.
</p>
<p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <code>noreturn</code>.  See <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

<dd><a name="index-Wstrict_002daliasing_003dn"></a>
<p>This option is only active when <samp>-fstrict-aliasing</samp> is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way <samp>-O</samp> 
works.
<samp>-Wstrict-aliasing</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</samp>.
</p>
<p>Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but <samp>-fstrict-aliasing</samp> still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.
</p>
<p>Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.
</p>
<p>Level 3 (default for <samp>-Wstrict-aliasing</samp>):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
<code>*(int*)&amp;some_float</code>.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.
Does not warn about incomplete types.

<p>This option is only active when <samp>-fstrict-overflow</samp> is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.
</p>
<p>An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.

<p>Warn about functions that might be candidates for attributes
<code>pure</code>, <code>const</code> or <code>noreturn</code>.  The compiler only warns for
functions visible in other compilation units or (in the case of <code>pure</code> and
<code>const</code>) if it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A function
returns normally if it doesn&rsquo;t contain an infinite loop or return abnormally
by throwing, calling <code>abort()</code> or trapping.  This analysis requires option
<samp>-fipa-pure-const</samp>, which is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and
higher.  Higher optimization levels improve the accuracy of the analysis.

<a name="index-Wno_002dformat-1"></a>

<p>Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for <code>format</code>
attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.
GCC guesses that function pointers with <code>format</code> attributes that
are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding <code>format</code> attribute in the
resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type
of the containing function respectively should also have a <code>format</code>
attribute to avoid the warning.
</p>
<p>GCC also warns about function definitions that might be
candidates for <code>format</code> attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  GCC guesses that <code>format</code> attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like
<code>vprintf</code> or <code>vscanf</code>, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which <code>format</code> attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.

<p>Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command-line option tells
GCC to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using <samp>-Wall</samp> in conjunction with this

<dt><code>-Wtrampolines</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wtrampolines"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dtrampolines"></a>
<p>Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions.
</p>
<p>A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
 time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and
 is used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it
 is made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But,
 for most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack
 to be made executable in order for the program to work properly.

<dd><a name="index-Wfloat_002dequal"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dfloat_002dequal"></a>
<p>Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.
</p>
<p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that&rsquo;s a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

<dt><code>-Wtraditional <span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wtraditional"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dtraditional"></a>
<p>Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in ISO C it does not.

</li><li> In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo; appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<samp>-Wtraditional</samp> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo; does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
&lsquo;<samp>#pragma</samp>&rsquo; not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize &lsquo;<samp>#elif</samp>&rsquo;, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.

</li><li> A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

</li><li> The unary plus operator.

</li><li> The &lsquo;<samp>U</samp>&rsquo; integer constant suffix, or the &lsquo;<samp>F</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>L</samp>&rsquo; floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the &lsquo;<samp>L</samp>&rsquo; suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the &lsquo;<samp>_MIN</samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp>_MAX</samp>&rsquo; macros in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC&rsquo;s integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

</li><li> A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

</li><li> A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

</li><li> A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.

</li><li> The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

</li><li> Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

</li><li> Initialization of automatic aggregates.

</li><li> Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.

</li><li> Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code>__STDC__</code> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.

</li><li> Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use <samp>-Wtraditional-conversion</samp>.

</li><li> Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features appear in your code when using
libiberty&rsquo;s traditional C compatibility macros, <code>PARAMS</code> and
<code>VPARAMS</code>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
<code>void func(void); if (func)</code>, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as <code>if (x == &quot;abc&quot;)</code>.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified

<a name="index-NFKC"></a>
<a name="index-character-set_002c-input-normalization"></a>
<p>In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some <em>normalization rules</em> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
</p>
<p>There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The default is
<samp>-Wnormalized=nfc</samp>, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the ISO 10646 &ldquo;C&rdquo; normalized form, <em>NFC</em>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there&rsquo;s no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.
<samp>-Wnormalized=id</samp> suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
</p>
<p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<samp>-Wnormalized=none</samp>.  You should only do this if you
are using some other normalization scheme (like &ldquo;D&rdquo;), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.
</p>
<p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <code>\u207F</code>, &ldquo;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N&rdquo;, displays just like a regular <code>n</code> that has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <em>NFKC</em>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC warns if your code is not in NFKC if you use
<samp>-Wnormalized=nfkc</samp>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment 
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

<p>Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable <code>f.x</code> in <code>struct bar</code>
is misaligned even though <code>struct bar</code> does not itself
have the packed attribute:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">struct foo {

<p>The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the <code>packed</code> attribute
on bit-fields of type <code>char</code>.  This has been fixed in GCC 4.4 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  GCC
informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in GCC 4.4.
For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding between field <code>a</code>
and <code>b</code> in this structure:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">struct foo
{
  char a:4;
  char b:8;

<p>Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.
Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
</p>
<p>The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the

however, &lsquo;<samp>offsetof</samp>&rsquo; typically gives meaningful results even when

Vector operation can be implemented <code>piecewise</code>, which means that the

<p>Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with a
non-trivial C++11 move assignment operator.  This is dangerous because
if the virtual base is reachable along more than one path, it will be
moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end up in the

not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that GCC&rsquo;s optimizers are unable to handle the code

</p>
<p>The limit applies <em>after</em> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.
